Note from Evan - 
We have a problem in this directory!! I've been doing stores incorrectly.

What we want is this: 
  - App renders, and stores are created.
  - As user navigates around, stores persist and change as necessary


What we have is this:
  - App renders
  - When user navigates to a component which uses stores,
    the stores are created. Once that component goes out of
    scope, the stores are deleted.

This is bad. The whole benefit of stores is that they render once and then
we get to use the data the whole time.

So: https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/ I think we need to use Vuex. Maybe. Not sure.
